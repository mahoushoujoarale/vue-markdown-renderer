    "left": "center"
  },
  "tooltip": {
    "trigger": "item"

      {"name": "客诉率", "max": 100}
    ],
    "shape": "polygon",
    "splitNumber": 5
  },
  "series": [{
    "type": "radar",
    "data": [
      {
        "value": [90, 68, 72, 88, 75, 85],
        "name": "智能硬件",
        "itemStyle": {"color": "#5470c6"},

        "name": "企业定制",
        "itemStyle": {"color": "#fac858"},
        "areaStyle": {"opacity": 0.3}
      }
    ]
  }]
}
```

### 4.3 Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Projection

We built a CLV prediction model based on historical data:

$$
CLV = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{R_t - C_t}{(1 + d)^{t-1}}
$$

Where:

- $R_t$ = revenue in period $t$
- $C_t$ = cost in period $t$
- $d$ = discount rate (12%)
- $n$ = customer lifetime

Average CLV by segment:

$$
\begin{align}
CLV_{\text{High Value}} &= ¥19,456 \\
CLV_{\text{Growth Potential}} &= ¥7,532 \\
CLV_{\text{Retention}} &= ¥4,183 \\
CLV_{\text{General}} &= ¥1,455
\end{align}
$$

**ROI Insights**:

- Average CAC: ¥420
- LTV/CAC for high-value customers reaches **46.3**, far exceeding the healthy benchmark of 3:1
- Recommendation: increase acquisition investment targeting high-value segments
